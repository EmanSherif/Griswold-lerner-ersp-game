# CodeBot and Quiz

A turn-based game based on helping students learn about software testing - specifcally statement coverage. We will be comparing this game 
with an ungamified version (Quiz) to see which one is more engaging, motivating, and fun.

The game's rules are as follows:
The player will have chances to input arguments into a function displayed on the screen and the objective is the execute all
the lines within the function with as few inputs as possible. Depending on how efficient the inputs are, CodeBot will take/deal damage
accordingly.

The quiz's rules are as follows:
Same as the game, except there are no graphical components or visuals.
