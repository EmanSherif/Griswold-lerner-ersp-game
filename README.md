# Griswold-lerner-ersp-game

The main component of our game will be collecting inputs from the user to use as different parameters into a function. When the game begins, code for a specific function will be printed as the level, and the user must input distinct parameters as many times as they deem necessary to be able to reach every line of code. The functions will vary in content, such as mathematical or logical functions. Depending on the type of function, the parameters needed to play the game will change, but there will be a main focus on primitive types: ints, doubles, or floats. The fundamental structure of the game consists of a backend coded in JAVA, using the classes and objects associated with this language to help organize the code. JAVA allows us to implement the game according to the single reponsibility program. Furthermore, because the game is terminal-based the front end will consist of print statements.
